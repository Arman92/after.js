# Getting Started

## Quick Start

You can quickly bootstrap an SSR React app with After.js using Razzle. While Razzle is not required, this documentation assumes you have the tooling setup for an isomorphic React application.

```bash
yarn global add create-after-app
create-after-app myapp
cd myapp
yarn start
```

Refer to [Razzle's](https://razzlejs.org) docs for tooling, babel, and webpack customization.

## Initialize App Using Examples

You can also initialize a project from one of the examples that are available in [exmples directory of the github repo](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/after.js/tree/master/examples).

```bash
yarn create after-app --example with-redux my-after-with-redux-app
cd my-after-with-redux-app
```
