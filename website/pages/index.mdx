Next.js is awesome. However, its routing system isn't for me. IMHO React Router is a better foundation upon which such a framework should be built....and that's the goal here:

- Routes are just components and don't / should not have anything to do with folder structure. Static route configs are fine.
- Next.js's `getInitialProps` was/is a brilliant idea.
- Route-based code-splitting should come for free or be easy to opt into.
- Route-based transitions / analytics / data loading / preloading etc. , should either come for free or be trivial to implement on your own.
